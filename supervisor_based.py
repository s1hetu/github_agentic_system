Supervisor-based agent.

This script implements a supervisor-based agent system for automating GitHub-related tasks.
It uses LangChain and other libraries to create a modular, state-driven workflow for managing
repositories, commits, and other GitHub operations.

Key Features:
- Modular agents for specific tasks (e.g., creating repositories, commits, README files).
- Supervisor agent to orchestrate task execution.
- Integration with LangChain for state management and tool invocation.
- Streamlit-based UI for user interaction.
